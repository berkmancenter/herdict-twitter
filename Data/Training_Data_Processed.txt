I'm still wondering why no mobile device utilizes the gyroscope in its everyday functionalities like scrolling up and down webpages... Duh!
@alisonpaiges something with the operating system they said. it won't let me open applications or load webpages. it wouldn't even shut down!
@HannahZakari info half way down this page http://t.co/dQBEfNji Free before 11:30
@majapapayamaja Well I do have twitter clients for that, please don't force feed this down my throat. I like my webpages nice and clean :)
Number of residence permit applications down by a fifth during the first months of the year
http://t.co/Mur3FOBn
@aman0791 - I never take down the webpages. Everything I've done over the last 6 years is still up there, for anyone who wants it!
I'm counting down the hours til #PrettyLittleLiars so I can take a break from creating these webpages #PLL #ITpains
@t_chevalier lots of mozilla webpages are down :D
@TEAMTaiwo lol! Do you know how many sites i've closed down because of that... music on webpages are never a good idea!
@HumanCompiler @shanselman A few things - it broke webpages (added 2.0.0 but didnt change the app setting key), and then broke razor.
@AlianaaaRose i think printing off the webpages and highlighting them, but i'm doing that in class cos me printers broke hahah! :-)
Best way to not get your heart broken, is pretend you don't have one.

Can anyone else open @Hilton UK webpages? Every link is broken...
@DeanAneke the internet works, like i can connect to it.... but i cant open webpages :(
Facebook is hella smart and paid, they went around to lyrics webpages pages for songs and you cant copy and paste, without logging into FB
@PlainShane dang! I love budgets but I would love to know how to make webpages. I only have 2 semesters though. Can't take anymore classes
@LillCesa I'm trying to access the webpages and I can't find them -.- going to have to email him and ask him about them!
can't decide whether to read the tweets and webpages now, or wait for the Keynote! #WWDC
There's nothing I hate more than webpages with video ads that automatically start & u can't stop. Surefire way to drive traffic away.
Running my 2nd malware scan. Can't load webpages even though I'm connected to the internet. Comes & goes.
