@ebertchicago I think your webpage has been hacked. Can't read any reviews. Every link leads to the Sports Authority's website.
To be perfectly honest, I still can't tell the difference between a tumblr and a Geocities webpage.
I hate when people ask me to fix their computers cause I'm in ist. Shit, I can make a webpage on how to fix it but I can't fix it lol.
Dear Daniel Dennett if you are so highly intelligent because you subscribe to reason, why is it I can't read your webpage? #40yrsofinternet

@StefanC yeah but I don't have to zoom in on webpages using this. Plus its the massive display that sucks down battery, so I keep that off.
My days just seem to be constant scrolling up and down webpages.
I'm still wondering why no mobile device utilizes the gyroscope in its everyday functionalities like scrolling up and down webpages... Duh!
